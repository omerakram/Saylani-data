<h1><b><u>Hazrat Abu Ubaidah bin al Jarrah</u></b></h1>
<p> Hazrat Abu Ubaidah (R.A) was very humble and modest. Amongst his friends, he was gentle and soft hearted. However when it came to war, he (R.A) was a great warrior. The Holy Prophet (S.A.W) said: “Every Ummah (nation) has a trustee; the trustee of my Ummah (Nation) is Abu Ubaidah bin Jarrah.”
    One of the greatest tests faced by Hazrat Abu Ubaidah (R.A) was at the Battle of Badr. Hazrat Abu Ubaidah (R.A) advanced into the midst of the battle field, tearing his (R.A) way in, causing havoc within the enemy lines. Every time he (R.A) advanced towards a person on horseback, they made way for him, but there was one man among them who would stand in front of him and challenge him, and try to attack him. When Hazrat Abu Ubaidah (R.A) realised that this person was his father, he was stunned and shocked, Hazrat Abu Ubaidah (R.A) was forced to attack him and he (R.A) killed him. Allah (S.W.T) revealed an Ayah of the Quran regarding Hazrat Abu Ubaidah (R.A):
    You will never find those who believe in Allah and the Day of Rising making friends with anyone who is hostile to Allah and His Messenger (S.A.W), even though they are their fathers (and forefathers), or their sons (and grandsons), or their brothers, or their near relatives. It is they in whose hearts Allah has inscribed faith and has strengthened them with His spirit (i.e. special spiritual benefit); And He will admit them to the Gardens with streams flowing under them. They will live in them forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Allah. It is they who are the party of (the devotees of) Allah. Remember! It is the party of (the devotees of) Allah that attain to the goal. (Surah 58 al-Mujadala, Verse 22)
    During the Battle of Uhud, a group of Quraish infantry managed to break through the barricade and advanced within stone throwing distance of the Prophet (S.A.W). They began to hurl stones, resulting in injuring the blessed Face, Teeth, Lip and Forehead of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W). Furthermore a stone struck His (S.A.W) blessed Cheek causing two links of the Prophet (S.A.W)’s chained helmet to drive into His Cheek Bone. Hazrat Abu Bakr (R.A) and Hazrat Abu Ubaidah (R.A) along with other Companions (R.A) rushed towards the Holy Prophet (S.A.W) to aid in anyway they could. Hazrat Abu Ubaidah (R.A) requested Hazrat Abu Bakr (R.A) to let him (R.A) take out the links, even though Hazrat Abu Bakr (R.A) was reluctant (as he (R.A) wanted to take up this duty himself) he (R.A) allowed Hazrat Abu Ubaidah (R.A) to take up the task.
